Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

###Challenge

Kickstarter campaigns for plays (subcategory) are more likely to be successful when the goal is to collect less than $50,000.  The likelihood of success decreases with goals of higher amount, with an unexplained increase of success for campaigns for $35,000 to less than $45,000.  One area to explore is if it is necessary to convert values due to currency differences; this could be causing some error.  

Considering all theater campaigns, those launched in May had the highest likelihood of success, and steadily decreasing in success in the following months.  Campaigns launched in December are least likely to succeed. 

Additional questions to consider: Are campaigns that with smaller goals amounts likelier to succeed in different months than campaigns with higher goal amounts? Or are do they both follow the same trends seen for all theater campaigns.  Are theater campaigns trends by launch date the same for all countries? And, how does the trend for theater compare to trends for other categories?
